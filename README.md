# DeLorean-Dark-3.18
latest DeLorean theme for gtk-3.22
Only the GNOME Shell theme is working and even that could probably be considered a hackjob.

I have no experience with GTK+ themes whatsoever and I'm not a designer (I lack both skill and talent).
So GNOME Shell 3.22 users, feel free to download and use this theme!

For changing back to the glass look, see the changes I made where I either:
    removed "transparent" or
    replaced it with "#2C2C2E"
